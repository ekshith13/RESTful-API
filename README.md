# RESTful-API-
Project Title: Predictive Analysis for Manufacturing Operations

Overview: This project is all about creating a simple predictive analysis model for manufacturing data. It involves setting up a RESTful API that enables users to upload data, train the model, and make predictions about machine downtime or production defects.

Objectives:

Develop a predictive analysis model using manufacturing data.

Create RESTful API endpoints for:

Uploading data

Training the model

Retrieving predictions

Dataset: We'll use a small dataset related to manufacturing (e.g., Machine Downtime or Product Defects) from sources like Kaggle or the UCI Machine Learning Repository. If no dataset is available, we'll generate synthetic data with these key columns:

Machine_ID

Temperature

Run_Time

Downtime_Flag

Model: We'll employ a straightforward supervised machine learning model, such as:

Logistic Regression

Decision Tree

The model will be trained on the uploaded dataset to predict machine downtime or product defects.

API Endpoints:

Upload Endpoint

Method: POST

Endpoint: /upload

Description: Accepts a CSV file containing manufacturing data (e.g., Machine_ID, Temperature, Run_Time).

Train Endpoint

Method: POST

Endpoint: /train

Description: Trains the model on the uploaded dataset and returns performance metrics such as accuracy and F1-score.

Predict Endpoint

Method: POST

Endpoint: /predict

Description: Accepts JSON input (e.g., {"Temperature": 80, "Run_Time": 120}) and returns predictions (e.g., Downtime: Yes/No).
